## 🔍 Verify Backend is Running:

### Test in Browser:
```
http://10.113.107.90:8000/api/products
```
- Should show product JSON
- Confirms backend is accessible

### Test in Terminal:
```bash
curl http://10.113.107.90:8000/api/products
```

## 💡 Important Notes:

1. **Backend Must Be Running**
   - Make sure your Laravel backend is running on port 8000
   - Should be accessible at 10.113.107.90:8000

2. **Same Network Required**
   - Device/simulator must be on same WiFi as backend
   - IP 10.113.107.90 must be reachable

3. **Firewall Check**
   - Ensure firewall allows connections on port 8000
   - Test with curl if connection fails

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

### With Backend Running:
✅ Login works with real credentials  
✅ Products load from database  
✅ Real-time data updates  
✅ All API features functional  

### Without Backend:
⚠️ Login will show error (expected)  
⚠️ Products won't load  
✅ Profile features work (AsyncStorage)  
✅ Theme toggle works (local)  

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "Network Error"
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend is running: `ps aux | grep php`
2. Test URL in browser: `http://10.113.107.90:8000/api/products`
3. Check firewall settings

### Issue: "Cannot connect"
**Solution**:
1. Verify both devices on same network
2. Ping backend: `ping 10.113.107.90`
3. Check backend port: `lsof -i :8000`

### Issue: "Timeout"
**Solution**:
1. Increase timeout in constants (currently 10000ms)
